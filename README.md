# reddit-clone

This project is the second individual assignment provided by my teacher in Teknikh√∂gskolan - Lund. The assignment in question is to build a Reddit clone, fully functional
with a html/css layout and javascript elements that can store user prompts and simulate the browsing experience in Reddit. The main goal of the assignment is to learn basic
JS functionality and how to implement it in a front-end environment. This project is built using VSCode and Git.
